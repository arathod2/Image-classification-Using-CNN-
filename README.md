# Image-classification-Using-CNN-
Applied AI Assignment

This project consists of two goals: (1) compare
the performance of multiple CNN pre-trained models studied in
class and (2) propose a new model that can improve the
performance of the best pre-trained model.

The libraries used in the program were:
1. Numpy for mathematical calculations on matrices and arrays.
2. Pandas for handling data in the form of DataFrames.
3. Matplotlib.pyplot and Seaborn for data visualization.
4. Scikit-Learn for machine learning tools and algorithms.
5. Tensorflow is for tasks related to Deep Learning.
6. Keras contains tools for the implementation of artificial neural network building blocks. It
provides a python interface for tensorflow.
